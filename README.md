## 1. Is preserving archetype names across A1 → C2 effective?

### Verdict: **Yes — if archetypes represent communicative functions, not word lists.**

Your current modules already do this well:

* *Social Lubricant*
* *The Transaction*
* *The Navigator*
* *The Repair Kit*
* *The Troubleshooter*

These are **functional domains of human interaction**, not beginner-only concepts. Humans don’t “outgrow” asking for help, negotiating, repairing misunderstandings, or navigating space — they **increase precision, nuance, and abstraction**.

That’s exactly what CEFR levels describe.

**What stays fixed**

* Archetype name
* Communicative intent
* Cognitive purpose (“what this lets me do in the world”)

**What evolves**

* Sentence complexity
* Grammatical load
* Register (informal → formal → rhetorical)
* Vocabulary density
* Cultural subtlety

If you renamed archetypes at every level, learners would constantly have to *re-map mental models*. Keeping names stable actually **reduces cognitive overhead**.

## 2. Is this approach limiting for advanced learners?

### Verdict: **Only if you freeze the internal structure.**

The risk is *not* archetypes — the risk is **flat expansion**.

Bad progression:

> Add more words, longer sentences, same interaction shape

Good progression:

> Add **new communicative moves inside the same archetype**

### Example: “The Transaction”

* **A1**
  *How much is this? I’ll take it. Cash or card?*

* **A2**
  *Could I get a discount? That’s too expensive. I’d prefer another one.*

* **B1**
  *I was charged incorrectly. I’d like to return this.*

* **B2**
  *This doesn’t meet my expectations given the price point.*

* **C1**
  *I’d like to formally dispute this charge.*

* **C2**
  *The terms of sale were misrepresented at the point of purchase.*

Same archetype. Radically different linguistic power.

So the constraint is **architectural**, not conceptual.

## 3. Sentence + vocabulary training: is this structurally sound?

Yes — and your approach is actually stronger than most apps because:

* Vocabulary is **always embedded**
* Sentences are **functional**
* There is no artificial grammar-first sequencing

However, to scale cleanly you should treat vocabulary as:

> **Fuel injected into archetypes**, not a parallel curriculum.

That leads to the key design question you asked next 👇

---

## 4. How many vocabulary archetypes should exist?

### Optimal range: **8–12 total**

Fewer than 6 → too coarse
More than 14 → learners lose mental grip

Your current set is already close. I would recommend **10 archetypes**, grouped by *human function*, not topic.

---

## 5. Recommended vocabulary archetype names (CEFR-agnostic)

These names should survive A1 → C2 unchanged.

### Core Functional Archetypes (Primary)

1. **Social Lubricant**
   Greetings, politeness, openings, closings, tone management

2. **The Self**
   Identity, feelings, states, preferences, biography

3. **The Other**
   People, roles, relationships, social reference

4. **The World**
   Objects, places, environment, public space

5. **The Navigator**
   Direction, movement, location, spatial relations

6. **The Transaction**
   Exchange, value, services, negotiation

7. **The Quantifier**
   Amount, degree, time, frequency, comparison, scale

8. **The Troubleshooter**
   Problems, faults, dissatisfaction, repair

9. **The Repair Kit**
   Meta-language: clarification, repetition, misunderstanding

10. **The Lifeline**
    Safety, urgency, health, emergencies

---

## 6. How these scale cleanly across CEFR

Instead of “adding vocabulary”, each level should add **capabilities**:

| Level | What changes                             |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| A1    | Naming, pointing, basic intent           |
| A2    | Combining, choosing, simple reasoning    |
| B1    | Explaining, narrating, qualifying        |
| B2    | Arguing, contrasting, hypothesizing      |
| C1    | Register control, abstraction, diplomacy |
| C2    | Precision, persuasion, rhetorical nuance |

The archetype acts like a **container whose internal grammar complexity increases**.

---

## 7. Will learners feel boxed in?

If implemented correctly: **no — they feel grounded**.

Why?

* Archetypes give orientation (“I know what this is for”)
* CEFR level gives challenge
* Sentence training gives immediate payoff

This mirrors how adults *actually* learn languages when dropped into a country.

## 8. Final design principle (this is the key)

> **Archetypes are stable.
> Sentences evolve.
> Power increases.**
